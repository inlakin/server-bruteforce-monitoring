# Server (bruteforce) monitoring

The goals are :

- to be able to follow on a real time map the bruteforce attemps on a server (vps, dedicated, mutualized, self-hosted ...)

- to gather information about the attacker and run a vulnerabilities analysis if possible and draw reports regarding the attacker location, and most present vulnerabilities.
